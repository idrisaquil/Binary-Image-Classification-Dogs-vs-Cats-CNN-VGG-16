The "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset is a popular benchmark for image classification tasks, particularly for learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
It involves training a model to distinguish between images of dogs and cats, often using a subset of a larger dataset. 
The larger dataset contains 17,500 images (8,750 cats and 8,750 dogs).
